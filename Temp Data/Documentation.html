        <p>Using AI for Risk Management based on NIST CSF</p>
    </header>

    <section class="abstract">
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Organisations face challenges in deriving risks in a standard way from different processes, such as threat modelling and incident management. Some mature organisations use commercial tools to streamline the risk management process, but these tools are often complex and ineffective This project proposes a new approach to risk management that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the process of risk identification and prioritisation.</p>
    </section>
	<section class="approach_target_standard">
		<h2>Approach Target standard</h2>
		<p>for risk management is NIST CSF. The risks must be categorised to IS and DP risks</p>

		<p>based on the threat or incident context.</p>

		<p>To simplify the NLP part we could compose the text of the threat or incident definition to a standard form to derive the key parameters from the input text. Then the ML must be trained with different input collections of these parameters to identify the equivalent mapping in NIST standard
		</p>

    <section class="data-processing">
        <h2>Data Collection and Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>The project begins by collecting data from <a href="https://capec.mitre.org/data/index.html" target="_blank">CAPEC Website</a>,
		consolidating it into a cohesive dataset through a Python program. To ensure data quality, 
		missing values and outliers are addressed. Additionally, non-numeric data is transformed into
		a numeric format for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The heart of the project lies in its machine learning models, each designed to predict specific aspects of risk.</p>

            <h3>Model Training</h3>
            <p>The models are trained on historical incident reports using a RandomForestClassifier. The training involves feeding the models with various input collections of parameters derived from incident descriptions. This process allows the models to learn and identify equivalent mappings in alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.</p>

        <p>The project employs Flask for the frontend, providing a user-friendly interface. Users can input incident descriptions, and the system predicts various risk parameters based on the trained machine learning models.</p>
