Malicious Automated Software Update via Redirection,Detailed,Draft,"An attacker exploits two layers of weaknesses in server or client software for automated update mechanisms to undermine the integrity of the target code-base. The first weakness involves a failure to properly authenticate a server as a source of update or patch content. This type of weakness typically results from authentication mechanisms which can be defeated, allowing a hostile server to satisfy the criteria that establish a trust relationship.

Signing Malicious Code,Detailed,Draft,"The adversary extracts credentials used for code signing from a production environment and then uses these credentials to sign malicious content with the developer's key. Many developers use signing keys to sign code or hashes of code. When users or applications verify the signatures are accurate they are led to believe that the code came from the owner of the signing key and that the code has not been modified since the signature was applied. If the adversary has extracted the signing credentials then they can use those credentials to sign their own code bundles. Users or tools that verify the signatures attached to the code will likely assume the code came from the legitimate developer and install or run the code, effectively allowing the adversary to execute arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

This is either a broad or targeted attack. If an adversary was able to steal a certificate from a targeted organization, they could target this organization by pretending to have legitimate code signed by them. In other cases, the adversary would simply sign their malware and pose as legitimate software such that any user might trust it.

Bypassing ATA Password Security,Detailed,Draft,"An adversary exploits a weakness in ATA security on a drive to gain access to the information the drive contains without supplying the proper credentials. ATA Security is often employed to protect hard disk information from unauthorized access. The mechanism requires the user to type in a password before the BIOS is allowed access to drive contents. Some implementations of ATA security will accept the ATA command to update the password without the user having authenticated with the BIOS. This occurs because the security mechanism assumes the user has first authenticated via the BIOS prior to sending commands to the drive. Various methods exist for exploiting this flaw, the most common being installing the ATA protected drive into a system lacking ATA security features (a.k.a. hot swapping). Once the drive is installed into the new system the BIOS can be used to reset the drive password.",,,,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:401::,,::Access to the system containing the ATA Drive so that the drive can be physically removed from the system.::,,,,,"::Avoid using ATA password security when possible.::Use full disk encryption to protect the entire contents of the drive or sensitive partitions on the drive.::Leverage third-party utilities that interface with self-encrypting drives (SEDs) to provide authentication, while relying on the SED itself for data encryption.::","::The A-FF Repair Station tool is a data recovery utility that can be used for ATA password removal (both High and Maximum level) and firmware area recovery.
