Malicious Automated Software Update via Redirection,Detailed,Draft,"An attacker exploits two layers of weaknesses in server or client software for automated update mechanisms to undermine the integrity of the target code-base. The first weakness involves a failure to properly authenticate a server as a source of update or patch content. This type of weakness typically results from authentication mechanisms which can be defeated, allowing a hostile server to satisfy the criteria that establish a trust relationship. The second weakness is a systemic failure to validate the identity and integrity of code downloaded from a remote location, hence the inability to distinguish malicious code from a legitimate update.",,High,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:186::,,,,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands::,,,::494::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1072:ENTRY NAME:Software Deployment Tools::,

WiFi MAC Address Tracking,Detailed,Draft,"In this attack scenario, the attacker passively listens for WiFi messages and logs the associated Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. These addresses are intended to be unique to each wireless device (although they can be configured and changed by software).

Rooting SIM Cards,Detailed,Draft,"SIM cards are the de facto trust anchor of mobile devices worldwide. The cards protect the mobile identity of subscribers, associate devices with phone numbers, and increasingly store payment credentials, for example in NFC-enabled phones with mobile wallets. This attack leverages over-the-air (OTA) updates deployed via cryptographically-secured SMS messages to deliver executable code to the SIM.

Cellular Broadcast Message Request,Detailed,Draft,"In this attack scenario, the attacker uses knowledge of the targetâ€™s mobile phone number (i.e., the number associated with the SIM used in the retransmission device) to cause the cellular network to send broadcast messages to alert the mobile device. Since the network knows which cell tower the targetâ€™s mobile device is attached to, the broadcast messages are only sent in the Location Area Code (LAC) where the target is currently located.
