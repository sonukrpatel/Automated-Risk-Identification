Malicious Automated Software Update via Redirection,Detailed,Draft,"An attacker exploits two layers of weaknesses in server or client software for automated update mechanisms to undermine the integrity of the target code-base. The first weakness involves a failure to properly authenticate a server as a source of update or patch content. This type of weakness typically results from authentication mechanisms which can be defeated, allowing a hostile server to satisfy the criteria that establish a trust relationship. The second weakness is a systemic failure to validate the identity and integrity of code downloaded from a remote location, hence the inability to distinguish malicious code from a legitimate update.",,High,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:186::,,,,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands::,,,::494::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1072:ENTRY NAME:Software Deployment Tools::,

WiFi MAC Address Tracking,Detailed,Draft,"In this attack scenario, the attacker passively listens for WiFi messages and logs the associated Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. These addresses are intended to be unique to each wireless device (although they can be configured and changed by software).

Rooting SIM Cards,Detailed,Draft,"SIM cards are the de facto trust anchor of mobile devices worldwide. The cards protect the mobile identity of subscribers, associate devices with phone numbers, and increasingly store payment credentials, for example in NFC-enabled phones with mobile wallets. This attack leverages over-the-air (OTA) updates deployed via cryptographically-secured SMS messages to deliver executable code to the SIM. By cracking the DES key, an attacker can send properly signed binary SMS messages to a device, which are treated as Java applets and are executed on the SIM. These applets are allowed to send SMS, change voicemail numbers, and query the phone location, among many other predefined functions. These capabilities alone provide plenty of potential for abuse.",,,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:186::,,::A SIM card that relies on the DES cipher.::,"::SKILL:This is a sophisticated attack, but detailed techniques are published in open literature.:LEVEL:Medium::",,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands::,::Upgrade the SIM card to use the state-of-the-art AES or the somewhat outdated 3DES algorithm for OTA.::,,::327::,,

Cellular Broadcast Message Request,Detailed,Draft,"In this attack scenario, the attacker uses knowledge of the target’s mobile phone number (i.e., the number associated with the SIM used in the retransmission device) to cause the cellular network to send broadcast messages to alert the mobile device. Since the network knows which cell tower the target’s mobile device is attached to, the broadcast messages are only sent in the Location Area Code (LAC) where the target is currently located. By triggering the cellular broadcast message and then listening for the presence or absence of that message, an attacker could verify that the target is in (or not in) a given location.",,,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:292::,,::The attacker must have knowledge of the target’s mobile phone number.::,::SKILL:Open source and commercial tools are available for this attack.:LEVEL:Low::,,,::SCOPE:Other:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other:NOTE:An attacker could verify that the target is in (or not in) a given location.::,::Frequent changing of mobile number.::,,::201::,,
